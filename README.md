## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely to access the platform's features.
- **Programming Resource Catalog:** Browse through a vast collection of programming books and notes categorized by languages, frameworks, topics, and difficulty levels.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for resources using keywords, titles, authors, or categories.
- **Shopping Cart:** Add books and notes to the cart for later purchase and manage the cart contents.
- **Checkout Process:** Secure checkout process for acquiring selected resources with various payment options.
